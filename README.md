## ✨ Key Features

- **Dual Note Formats:** Choose between two distinct types of notes:
    - **Digital Notes:** Rich, comprehensive documents featuring summaries, key topics, auto-generated images, flowcharts, and practice questions. Perfect for digital archiving and review.
    - **Physical Notes Layout:** A minimalist, handwritten-style template, ideal for printing and supplementing with your own manual annotations.
- **AI-Powered Content Generation:** Utilizes the Google Gemini API with Google Search grounding to intelligently analyze the content of a YouTube video directly from its URL.
- **Dynamic Image Generation:** Automatically creates visual aids for digital notes based on content, enhancing comprehension and engagement.
- **High-Quality PDF Export:** Download your generated notes in a clean, print-ready PDF format with a single click.
- **Responsive & Modern UI:** A sleek, user-friendly interface built with Tailwind CSS, featuring seamless light and dark mode support.
- **Robust & Reliable:** Works directly with the YouTube URL, eliminating dependencies on fragile third-party transcript services.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser.
- A valid Google AI Studio API key.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/keepupwithpawan/Scribbl-AI.git
    cd scribbl-ai
    ```

2.  **Set up your environment variables:**
    This application requires a Google Gemini API key to function. This key is typically managed by the environment you are deploying to. If running locally, you may need to configure it based on your setup.

3.  **Run the application:**
    Open the `index.html` file in your browser, or serve the project directory using a local web server.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1.  **Input:** The user pastes a YouTube video URL into the input field.
2.  **Note Type Selection:** The user chooses to generate either "Digital Notes" or a "Physical Notes Layout".
3.  **AI Content Analysis:** A carefully crafted prompt, including the YouTube URL, is sent to the Gemini API. The API is instructed to use its built-in Google Search capabilities to find and understand the video's content.
4.  **Content Generation:**
    - For **Digital Notes**, the API returns structured JSON containing a title, summary, key topics, charts, and questions. The application then makes subsequent API calls to generate images for the specified `image_idea` prompts.
    - For **Physical Notes**, the API returns a concise JSON layout optimized for handwriting.
5.  **Rendering:** The structured JSON response is parsed and rendered into a polished, readable format using React components.
6.  **PDF Export:** The user can download the final notes as a PDF, which is generated by capturing the rendered component using `html2canvas` and `jsPDF`.
